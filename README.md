![iris-machinelearning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/228e4912-9c47-4bce-95f7-6cc4d5b6a099)

## Overview
This project explores the "Iris" dataset, originally published at the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris DataSet. This small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing machine learning algorithms and visualizations, such as Scatter Plots. Each row in the dataset represents an iris flower, including its species and the dimensions of its botanical parts: sepal and petal lengths and widths, measured in centimeters.

## Dataset Features
The Iris dataset includes the following features:
- **Sepal Length**: Length of the sepal in centimeters
- **Sepal Width**: Width of the sepal in centimeters
- **Petal Length**: Length of the petal in centimeters
- **Petal Width**: Width of the petal in centimeters
- **Species**: Species of the iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)

## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to apply basic data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms, particularly focusing on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model. The project also demonstrates the elbow method for determining the optimal number of clusters for KNN.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, among others.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyblx/iris_flower.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to explore the dataset and view the analysis results.
